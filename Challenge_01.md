# Joining Data Challenge

- Joining data is a fundamental operation in data science because there are vast amounts of information are generated from various sources, the ability to combine and integrate disparate datasets has become increasingly important.

## Writing a Program for Joining CSV Files 

- In this task, you will be joining multiple `CSV` files using either Python or R based on the "Month" column. The goal is to consolidate data from different files into a single dataset based on the corresponding month values.

- **Instructions**:
    - Choose your preferred programming language: Python or R.
    - Import the necessary libraries or packages for data manipulation and file handling.
    - Load the CSV files into your programming environment. Ensure that each file contains a "Month" column.
    - Explore and inspect the data from each CSV file to understand its structure and content.
    - Perform the join operation based on the "Month" column to combine the data from all CSV files.
    - Verify the joined dataset to ensure that the join operation was successful.
    - Save the joined dataset as a new CSV file.
    
- The data is available [here](https://github.com/DrSaadLa/DS-Challenges/tree/a65ab5b61a150ead3b3c080c1def67ba789b410f/Data/Arctic)    

- **Note**:
    - It is recommended to write a function which should be scalable and can join any number of datasets. 
    - Save the function as a program.

## Writing a Program for Joining Several Excel Files

 - In this second task, you are asked to join several excel files. The data is available [here](https://github.com/DrSaadLa/DS-Challenges/tree/a65ab5b61a150ead3b3c080c1def67ba789b410f/Data/Sales) 

## Writing a Program for Joining Several Excel Sheets

- Just like the first challenge, the same data is stored as an excel file with multiple sheets. 

- **Instructions**:
    - Write a program using either R or Python to join the sheets from the excel file. 
    - The file available [here](https://github.com/DrSaadLa/DS-Challenges/blob/a65ab5b61a150ead3b3c080c1def67ba789b410f/Data/Arctic/all_data.xlsx)
    
- **Note**: 
  - The program should be user-friendly, scalable and can be run by non-technicals. 


```python

```
